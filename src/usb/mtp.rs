/// Packet level implementation of a CDC-ACM serial port.
///
/// This class can be used directly and it has the least overhead due to directly reading and
/// writing USB packets with no intermediate buffers, but it will not act like a stream-like serial
/// port. The following constraints must be followed if you use this class directly:
///
/// - `read_packet` must be called with a buffer large enough to hold `max_packet_size` bytes.
/// - `write_packet` must not be called with a buffer larger than `max_packet_size` bytes.
/// - If you write a packet that is exactly `max_packet_size` bytes long, it won't be processed by the
///   host operating system until a subsequent shorter packet is sent. A zero-length packet (ZLP)
///   can be sent if there is no other data to send. This is because USB bulk transactions must be
///   terminated with a short packet, even if the bulk endpoint is used for stream-like data.
